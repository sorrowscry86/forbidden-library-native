Beatrice - Mentioned in the checklist but not in the AI-Comms.md file

Appears to have been involved in early planning and architecture phases
Currently assigned to help with release notes in Phase 4
Recommended Work Order
Based on the current project status and assignments, here's the recommended order of work:

Immediate Priority (Phase 2 - Frontend Development)
Albedo & Contractor:
Complete the SvelteKit frontend development (currently in progress)
Focus on building the component library first, then feature-specific components
Implement virtualization for long lists to ensure 60 FPS scrolling
Connect all UI components to the Rust backend via the Tauri IPC bridge
Secondary Priority (Phase 3.5 - Sentry Integration)
Pandora:

Implement backend Sentry integration for Rust/Tauri services
Set up cross-platform monitoring for Windows, macOS, and Linux
Configure performance KPI monitoring for sub-second startup and 60 FPS UI
Albedo:

Implement frontend Sentry integration for SvelteKit components
Configure crash reporting with user consent controls
Set up automated alerting for KPI violations
Third Priority (Phase 3 - Testing & Quality Assurance)
Pandora:

Conduct cross-platform testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux
Validate platform-specific features and behaviors
Ensure consistent performance across all platforms
Contractor:

Perform user acceptance testing with focus on "flow of thought"
Test complex multi-step workflows across different application features
Provide feedback for final adjustments
Albedo:

Create cross-platform release candidates for all target platforms
Ensure builds are production-ready for final testing
Fourth Priority (Phase 4 - Deployment & Release)
Albedo:

Set up production environment for signing application builds
Create signed, installable packages for all target operating systems
Establish distribution channel on GitHub repository
Albedo & Beatrice:

Draft comprehensive release notes for v1.0 launch
Document features, improvements, and known issues
Albedo & Contractor:

Create final v1.0.0 tag in Git repository
Oversee final release process
Fifth Priority (Phase 5 - Maintenance & Iteration)
Contractor:

Establish user feedback collection channel
Prioritize native features for future development
Codey, Jr.:

Update all project documentation to reflect final architecture
Remove references to obsolete web-based prototype
Parallel Work Streams
To optimize the development process, I recommend the following parallel work streams:

Frontend Development Stream:

Lead: Albedo with Contractor support
Focus: Complete SvelteKit frontend implementation
Timeline: Highest priority, should be completed first
Monitoring & Quality Stream:

Lead: Pandora
Focus: Sentry integration and cross-platform testing
Timeline: Can begin in parallel with frontend development
Release Preparation Stream:

Lead: Albedo with Beatrice support
Focus: Prepare for final release (signing, packaging, documentation)
Timeline: Should begin after frontend is mostly complete
Coordination Points
To ensure smooth collaboration, the following coordination points are critical:

Frontend-Backend Integration:

Albedo and Pandora should coordinate on IPC bridge usage and testing
Regular validation of frontend components against backend services
Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Pandora should provide early feedback on platform-specific issues
Albedo should address platform-specific UI concerns during development
Release Readiness:

All participants should coordinate on final release criteria
Contractor has final approval on release readiness
Summary of Next Steps
Albedo & Contractor: Focus on completing the SvelteKit frontend
Pandora: Begin Sentry integration for backend while frontend development progresses
Albedo: Implement frontend Sentry integration after core UI components are complete
Pandora: Conduct cross-platform testing once frontend is feature-complete
Contractor: Perform UAT on the integrated application
Albedo: Prepare release candidates and final distribution packages
Codey, Jr.: Update documentation to reflect final architecture
This approach ensures efficient use of each participant's specializations while maintaining a logical progression toward the completed application.

Delta Update â€” 2025-08-21

Frontend Build Unblock (Tauri SPA)

- Configured SvelteKit for Tauri-friendly SPA:
	- Enabled adapter-static fallback: index.html (svelte.config.js)
	- Added src/routes/+layout.ts with: ssr = false; prerender = true
- Outcome: Resolves adapter-static "dynamic routes" error during build.

Next Actions

- Run: pnpm run build
- Then: pnpm tauri:dev (smoke test IPC flows)

Notes on Environment

- No heavy virtualization required. Versions are already pinned (pnpm 8.15.0, Node >= 18). Optional later: rust-toolchain.toml (stable), .node-version for team consistency.

Owners

- Implemented: Albedo
- Execute & UAT: Contractor
