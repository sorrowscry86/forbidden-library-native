## 📋 Project Change Log

### **August 21, 2025 - Codey, Jr.**

**Action**: Performance Monitoring Module Refactoring - COMPLETED

**Changes**:

- ✅ **Refactored Monitoring Architecture**: Transformed single-file module into organized multi-file structure with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Fixed Startup Time Tracking**: Split `track_startup_time()` into `start_startup_tracking()` and `finish_startup_tracking()` for accurate measurement
- ✅ **Resolved Resource Leaks**: Implemented panic catching and automatic transaction management with `ScopedTransaction`
- ✅ **Standardized Error Handling**: Created `MonitoringError<E>` enum for consistent error types across all monitoring functions
- ✅ **Enhanced AI Request Tracking**: Improved `track_ai_request()` to handle and report errors properly
- ✅ **Made Performance Thresholds Configurable**: Created `PerformanceConfig` with environment-specific presets and builder pattern
- ✅ **Added Comprehensive Tests**: Created test suite covering all monitoring functionality
- ✅ **Created Documentation**: Added README.md, MIGRATION.md, and inline documentation

**Key Improvements**:

- **Accuracy**: Startup time now correctly measures the full application initialization process
- **Reliability**: All transactions are properly finished, even in error cases
- **Configurability**: Performance thresholds can be adjusted for different environments
- **Maintainability**: Code is now better organized, documented, and tested
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error types make error handling more consistent

**Impact**: The monitoring system now provides accurate performance metrics and reliable error tracking, enabling better observability and performance optimization. The refactored code is more maintainable and configurable, making it easier to adapt to different environments and requirements.

**Next Steps**: Integrate the refactored monitoring module with other components (database, IPC commands, AI services) to provide comprehensive performance monitoring across the application.

### **August 19, 2025 - Codey, Jr.**

**Action**: Phase 1 Initial Project Analysis & Ingestion - COMPLETED

**Changes**:

- ✅ Performed full recursive scan of project directory structure
- ✅ Identified technology stack: Rust/Tauri/SvelteKit with SQLCipher database
- ✅ Analyzed key configuration files (Cargo.toml, package.json, tauri.conf.json)
- ✅ Mapped Tauri IPC bridge architecture with 3 initial command handlers
- ✅ Ingested README.md and project documentation for contextual understanding
- ✅ Built foundational knowledge graph of project structure and dependencies

**Key Findings**:

- **Architecture Status**: Solid foundation established with proper Rust/Tauri/SvelteKit stack
- **IPC Bridge**: Currently has 3 command handlers (greet, get_app_version, initialize_database)
- **Missing Modules**: Database and services modules referenced in main.rs but not yet implemented
- **Frontend Structure**: SvelteKit directories (src/lib, src/routes) exist but are empty
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive Tauri security policies and build configuration in place

**Contextual Knowledge Graph Built**:

- **Core Dependencies**: Tauri 1.5, Tokio async runtime, SQLCipher encryption, Serde serialization
- **High-Leverage Files**: main.rs (entry point), commands.rs (IPC bridge), models.rs (data structures)
- **Critical Missing**: Database layer implementation, frontend components, service modules
- **Performance Stack**: Rust backend + SvelteKit frontend optimized for sub-second launch and 60 FPS UI

**Impact**: Complete contextual understanding established. Ready to provide intelligent assistance for Phase 3 implementation of core services and feature migration.

### **August 20, 2025 - Codey, Jr.**

**Action**: Critical Issue Detection & Resolution - COMPLETED

**Changes**:

- 🔧 **FIXED**: Corrupted JSON in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Line 4 had malformed string mixing "npm" command with `systemTray` config
- 🔧 **FIXED**: Duplicate main function in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Removed redundant second main function and duplicate imports
- 🔧 **IDENTIFIED**: Missing icon files in `src-tauri/icons/` directory - Required for Windows Resource file generation
- 🔧 **IDENTIFIED**: Rust PATH not set in current session - Located cargo at `$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin\cargo.exe`

**Critical Issues Found**:

1. **JSON Syntax Error**: `tauri.conf.json` had corrupted build configuration preventing compilation
    - **Before**: `"beforeDevCommand": "npm     "systemTray": {...}v"`
    - **After**: `"beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev"`
2. **Duplicate Code**: `main.rs` contained two main functions causing compilation conflicts
    - **Removed**: Lines 131-158 containing duplicate main function and imports
    - **Preserved**: Primary async main function with comprehensive error handling
3. **Missing Assets**: Icon files required for Tauri build process
    - **Location**: `src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` and `icon.png` missing
    - **Impact**: Prevents Windows Resource file generation during build
4. **Environment Issue**: Rust toolchain installed but not in current session PATH
    - **Solution**: Added `$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin` to PATH for current session
    - **Verification**: Cargo 1.89.0 confirmed working

**Build Status**:

- **Before Fixes**: Complete build failure due to JSON parsing errors
- **After JSON Fix**: Build progresses to icon file requirement
- **Next Step**: Need proper icon assets for successful compilation

**Impact**: Resolved critical compilation blockers. Project can now proceed with proper build process once icon assets are provided. All major structural issues in Rust backend resolved.

- ✅ **Unit Tests Implementation**: Created extensive test suites in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` and `src-tauri/src/services/mod.rs`
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarks**: Established `src-tauri/benches/performance_benchmarks.rs` with Criterion framework for KPI validation
- ✅ **Security Audit Tests**: Created `src-tauri/tests/security_audit.rs` for vulnerability testing (SQL injection, path traversal, XSS, input validation)
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Implemented `src-tauri/tests/integration_tests.rs` for complete workflow validation
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enhanced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with comprehensive testing suite across multiple platforms

### **August 22, 2025 - GitHub Copilot**

**Action**: Phase 6 Linear Wiring & Docs Cleanup - COMPLETED (with note)

**Changes**:

- ✅ **Linear Team Detection**: Confirmed team `VoidCatRDC` and active users
- ✅ **Issue Linking**: Attached Phase 6 issues to the project “Forbidden Library - Prototype to Production”
    - [VOI-61: Cross-Platform QA: Windows/macOS/Linux](https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-61/cross-platform-qa-windowsmacoslinux)
    - [VOI-62: UAT: Flow-of-Thought Workflows](https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-62/uat-flow-of-thought-workflows)
    - [VOI-63: Prepare Signed Release Candidates (RC)](https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-63/prepare-signed-release-candidates-rc)
    - [VOI-64: Frontend Sentry: WebView Instrumentation](https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-64/frontend-sentry-webview-instrumentation)
- ✅ **Docs Polish (Linear)**:
    - `docs/linear/README.md`: Added detected team section and fixed Markdown lint
    - `docs/linear/PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md`: Converted bare issue URLs to Markdown links

**Notes**:

- ⛔ Label creation requires admin scope in Linear; attempted labels (`testing`, `cross-platform`, `release`, `packaging`, `signing`, `monitoring`, `frontend`, `uat`, `user-testing`) were not created due to permissions. Issues currently remain without new labels.

**Next Steps**:

1. Create Phase 6 labels in Linear UI (admin) and apply them to VOI-61..64
2. Optionally create a dedicated Linear project for Phase 6 and move issues, or continue under the existing project
3. Mirror the Linear links and status into the project checklist for traceability

**Impact**: Phase 6 issues are now clearly linked to the primary project, and Linear documentation in-repo is lint-clean and accurate for the current workspace.
