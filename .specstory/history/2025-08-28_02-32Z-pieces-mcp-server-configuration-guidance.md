_**Assistant**_

You are referencing the Pieces MCP server configuration in your `mcp.json` file. According to the Pieces MCP documentation (https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started), the configuration you have:

```jsonc
"Pieces": {
    "url": "http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse",
    "type": "http"
}
```

is correct for connecting to a locally running Pieces MCP server.

To ensure everything works:

1. Make sure the Pieces MCP server is running on your machine at port 39300.
2. No further changes are needed in your `mcp.json` for the Pieces server unless you want to use a different port or remote server.

If you need to start the Pieces MCP server, follow the instructions in the Pieces documentation for your OS. If you have a specific issue or error, please provide details so I can assist further.

Use linear and figure out what the next steps should be taken in this repo

---

_**Assistant**_

There are currently no Linear issues found for the "forbidden-library-native" team. This means there are no tracked tasks, bugs, or next steps defined in Linear for this repository.

If you want to establish a workflow, consider:

- Creating new issues in Linear for features, bugs, or improvements you want to track.
- Reviewing your project goals or backlog and translating them into actionable Linear issues.

Let me know if you want help creating new issues or need suggestions for next steps based on your codebase or documentation.

create .env file with a place for Gemini API key. Search online for the proper way to do this.

---

_**Assistant**_

```

```

A placeholder for the Gemini API key has been added to your `.env` file as GEMINI_API_KEY, following best practices for environment variable naming. You can now add your actual Gemini API key to this variable. No further action is needed unless you want to use this key in your application code.
