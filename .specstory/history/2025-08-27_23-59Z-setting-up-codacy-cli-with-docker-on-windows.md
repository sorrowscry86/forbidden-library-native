# Setting up Codacy CLI with Docker on Windows (2025-08-27 23:59Z)

_**User**_

Install Codacy CLI

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fetch the repository's Codacy instructions to align with project standards, then set up Codacy CLI integration (Docker-based on Windows), add a VS Code task and a helper PowerShell script, and validate by running a quick CLI version check. I'll scan for an existing `` directory and tasks to avoid duplicates, then add a Codacy CLI helper PowerShell script and VS Code tasks; finally I'll validate Docker availability and run a quick version/image pull. Batching changes: I'll add a helper PowerShell script to run Codacy CLI via Docker, update VS Code tasks to expose Codacy scans, and include a brief docs page. Then I'll run Codacy MCP analysis on the edited files to comply with project rules. 
```

```
To complete the Codacy CLI setup and make it easy to run on Windows, I'll fix the PowerShell script lint issues, add VS Code tasks to run the Docker-based Codacy CLI (including a Trivy security scan), and include a small usage guide. Afterward, I'll run Codacy MCP analysis on the newly added/edited files to comply with project rules. 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
I'll quickly search the workspace for a `.codacyrc` path to understand why the container sees it as a directory and fix configuration accordingly. I’ll set up Codacy Analysis CLI for this repo on Windows using Docker, wire VS Code tasks for one-click runs, and validate the setup with a quick smoke test.

## Plan
- Add a PowerShell helper (`codacy-cli.ps1`) to run Codacy Analysis CLI via Docker.
- Add VS Code tasks to run Codacy analysis and a Trivy security scan.
- Document usage and prerequisites in `CODACY_CLI_SETUP.md`.
- Validate Docker availability and attempt a smoke run.
- Run Codacy MCP analysis on any files I edited (per project rules) and report status.

## What I changed (done)
- Added `codacy-cli.ps1` to run the official Codacy Analysis CLI container and analyze the repo:
  - Uses Docker image `codacy/codacy-analysis-cli:latest`.
  - Mounts the repo at `/workspace` inside the container.
  - Mounts the Docker socket for tool plugins that spin sub-containers.
  - Accepts `-Tool trivy` for a Trivy security scan, and `-Pull` to pre-pull the image.
- Extended VS Code tasks in `tasks.json`:
  - New task `Codacy: Analyze (Docker)`
  - New task `Codacy: Security Scan (Trivy)`
- Added `CODACY_CLI_SETUP.md` with clear Windows usage instructions and VS Code task references.

## How to run (Windows PowerShell)
- Pull the CLI image (optional):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/codacy-cli.ps1 -Pull
```
- Run a full analysis:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/codacy-cli.ps1
```
- Run a Trivy security scan:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/codacy-cli.ps1 -Tool trivy
```
- Alternatively via VS Code: Tasks: Run Task → `Codacy: Analyze (Docker)` or `Codacy: Security Scan (Trivy)`.

## Quick status
- Docker is available: `Docker version 28.3.2` detected.
- First `-Pull` attempt against GHCR was denied; switched to Docker Hub image `codacy/codacy-analysis-cli:latest`.
- After fixing Windows path mounting and socket mount, the CLI runs but some plugins complain about configuration (e.g., trying to read `/.codacyrc`):
  - This is expected if there’s no `.codacyrc` yet; the CLI still gathered metrics and scanned many files.
  - If you want cleaner output, we can add a minimal `.codacyrc` to control which tools run and patterns to include—say the word and I’ll add one tailored to this repo.

## Codacy MCP Server rule compliance
- Per `codacy.instructions.md`, after edits I must run the Codacy MCP `codacy_cli_analyze` tool for each edited file:
  - Attempted for:
    - `codacy-cli.ps1` → FAILED: MCP tried to install its own CLI via WSL (`curl` missing in WSL).
    - `tasks.json` → FAILED: same reason.
    - `CODACY_CLI_SETUP.md` → FAILED: same reason.
- Reason: The Codacy MCP tool on this machine is attempting to bootstrap the CLI via `wsl curl`, which isn’t available. Since the Docker-based CLI works locally, you can still run analyses via the new script/tasks while we sort the MCP environment.

Troubleshooting steps for the MCP tool (as per project instructions):
- Reset the MCP integration (VS Code: Copilot > MCP servers).
- Check GitHub settings to enable MCP servers:
  - User: https://github.com/settings/copilot/features
  - Org (admin/owner): https://github.com/organizations/sorrowscry86/settings/copilot/features
- If issues persist, contact Codacy support.

If you’d like, I can:
- Add a minimal `.codacyrc` now to eliminate config-related warnings and pin the tools we care about.
- Set up a CI job to run the Docker-based Codacy CLI on pushes/PRs.

## Validation and quality gates
- Build/lint/test were not changed by this installation; no Node/Rust dependency installs were performed.
- Codacy MCP analysis for edited files: FAIL (environment issue: WSL `curl` missing).
- Docker-based Codacy CLI: runs and reports, though some tool plugins warn due to missing `.codacyrc`.

## Requirements coverage
- Install Codacy CLI: Done via Docker helper script and VS Code tasks.
- Provide usage instructions: Done in `CODACY_CLI_SETUP.md`.
- Post-edit Codacy MCP analysis: Attempted; documented the failure and next steps per repo policy.

## Files touched
- `codacy-cli.ps1` (new)
- `tasks.json` (updated; two new tasks)
- `CODACY_CLI_SETUP.md` (new)

## Next steps (optional)
- Add `.codacyrc` to configure tools/patterns and clean up container plugin output.
- If desired, I’ll wire a GitHub Actions job to run `codacy/codacy-analysis-cli` on PRs.

Completion summary: Codacy Analysis CLI is installed for local use via Docker with one-click VS Code tasks. The Codacy MCP tool is present but failing auto-bootstrap (WSL `curl`); I’ve provided troubleshooting guidance and a working local alternative while MCP is fixed.
