# Synchronizing Phase 5 tasks with Linear (2025-08-27 12:39Z)

_**Assistant**_

To synchronize Phase 5 tasks with Linear, I’ll first gather the Phase 5 issue definitions from your repository and discover your Linear workspace setup (teams, statuses, labels, projects), so I can create or update the right issues and labels under the correct team and project. I’m going to check your Linear workspace for the team, project, existing labels, and whether the four Phase 5/6 issues already exist, so I can avoid duplicates and create whatever’s missing. I’ll look up the Sentry-related issue to get its ID, create a standard "Phase 6" label if needed, and add appropriate labels across the four Phase 5/6 issues to standardize tracking. To standardize tracking in Linear, I’ll fetch your team’s label list, create any missing labels for Phase 6 work, and apply them to the four Phase 5/6 issues so they’re consistently tagged. To finish synchronizing Phase 5/6 in Linear, I’ll attach standardized labels to the four key issues and confirm the canonical project reference. To complete the Linear sync, I’ll update your Linear docs to reflect the canonical project link and the label standardization I applied to the Phase 5/6 issues, so the repository mirrors the current Linear state.

Kicking off your Linear sync so Phase 5/6 work is tracked cleanly and linked from the repo.

Plan

- Parse the Phase 5 draft issues and your Linear workspace context.
- Discover teams, projects, and existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Standardize and apply labels; ensure all Phase 5/6 issues point to the canonical project.
- Update repository docs under docs/linear to mirror the current Linear state.
- Provide a compact status report with links and next steps.

What I did (now complete)

- Read your Phase 5 draft issues and Linear guide:
  - `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md`
  - `README.md`
- Discovered your Linear workspace team:
  - Team: VoidCatRDC (id: 82fc39e5-dd4e-4cd0-81a4-fcf63a32e158)
- Found the canonical project:
  - Forbidden Library (Phase 6)
  - https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbidden-library-phase-6-d55d9c47a500
- Located the four Phase 5/6 issues in Linear (no duplicates created):
  - VOI-66: Cross-Platform Testing: Windows/macOS/Linux full feature sweep
  - VOI-68: User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Flow-of-thought workflows
  - VOI-70: Code signing & packaging for Windows/macOS/Linux
  - VOI-67: Frontend Sentry Integration (SvelteKit)
- Created/verified a standard label set for Phase 6 tracking and applied labels to the four issues:
  - Labels added/verified: Phase 6, testing, cross-platform, release, uat, user-testing, packaging, signing, monitoring, frontend
  - VOI-66: Phase 6, testing, cross-platform, release
  - VOI-68: Phase 6, uat, user-testing
  - VOI-70: Phase 6, release, packaging, signing
  - VOI-67: Phase 6, monitoring, frontend
- Confirmed these issues sit under canonical project “Forbidden Library (Phase 6)”.
- Updated repo documentation to mirror the Linear state:
  - `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md`
    - Added “Sync status (2025-08-27)” section with canonical project link, standardized labels, and label application per issue.
  - `README.md`
    - Added “Standardized labels for Phase 6 tracking” list and reinforced canonical project link.

- Canonical project: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbidden-library-phase-6-d55d9c47a500

Repository changes (docs only)

- Updated: `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md`
- Updated: `README.md`

Next steps I can take (optional)

- Assign owners and set priorities on VOI-66/68/70/67 per your preferences.
- Create a “Phase 6” cycle and add these issues to the current cycle.
- Back-link Linear issue IDs into your main project checklist for Phase 5/6 (e.g., `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md` is already annotated; I can also add IDs to Project Checklist\_ Forbidden Library - Ground-Up Implementation.md).
- Batch-apply standardized labels to adjacent release tasks (VOI-71, VOI-72, etc.) for consistent querying.

Requirements coverage

- “Use Linear to work on project”: Done
  - Synced issues to canonical project, standardized labels, ensured no duplicates, and updated repo docs to reflect Linear truth.
  - Provided links and a concise status.

If you want me to auto-assign these or set up a Phase 6 cycle, I’ll proceed and update the docs accordingly.
