Plan: I’ll register GitHub Copilot in the Agent Registry and add a Change Log entry for today to document this session’s actions and next steps, keeping the formatting consistent with the existing document.

```

```

I’m going to open the `AI-Comms.md` file to verify the exact context around my inserted section and then adjust spacing to satisfy markdown lint rules (blank lines around headings and lists) without altering unrelated content. Validation: I reviewed the file to spot formatting issues around the newly inserted section and will now add blank lines around headings and lists within the GitHub Copilot sections to satisfy markdown lint rules without altering other content. Applying a focused patch to fix Markdown lint issues around the newly added GitHub Copilot sections by inserting required blank lines around headings and lists and removing trailing spaces where needed. Purpose: Fix markdown lint issues (blank lines around headings and lists, and trailing spaces) in the newly added GitHub Copilot sections of `AI-Comms.md` to maintain formatting consistency and pass linters.

I'll apply targeted edits: insert blank lines above/below headings and before list blocks, and remove trailing spaces in the "Changes" label.

```

```

Checkpoint: I’m going to clean up the GitHub Copilot section in `AI-Comms.md` by removing stray list markers, fixing the italic quote, and ensuring proper blank lines around lists and headings to satisfy markdown lint rules.

```

```
