Your Tauri build failed due to a missing private key. The error message is:

> Error A public key has been found, but no private key. Make sure to set `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

To launch the app, you need to resolve this key issue. If you want to run the app in development mode (without building a release installer), you can use the Tauri dev command, which does not require signing keys.

I'll launch the app in development mode for you. The app is launching in Tauri development mode. This mode does not require the private key and should allow you to run and test your application.

If you want to build a production installer in the future, you'll need to set the `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable with your private key for signing.

Let me know if you need help with anything else or if you want to resolve the signing key issue for production builds.
