# Verifying Linear MCP Server Connectivity and Data (2025-08-27 11:08Z)

_**User**_

Check Linear

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll quickly probe the Linear MCP server by listing teams to confirm it's reachable and correctly configured; if successful, I’ll summarize the workspace teams and next steps. I’m going to query Linear for key workspace metadata (statuses, cycles, projects, labels, and a few recent issues) to verify connectivity and provide a concise snapshot of your setup. I’ll fetch labels (workspace-wide) and list all cycles to complete the snapshot and confirm everything’s accessible. I’ll verify your Linear MCP setup is reachable and summarize the key workspace state so you know it’s wired correctly.

## Plan

- Confirm MCP connectivity to Linear
- Identify available team(s)
- Pull team workflow statuses
- List projects, labels, and cycles
- Show a quick slice of recent issues for sanity

## Connectivity

- Status: Connected to Linear MCP at `https://mcp.linear.app/sse`
- Team(s):
  - `VoidCatRDC` (id: `82fc39e5-dd4e-4cd0-81a4-fcf63a32e158`)

## Team Workflow Statuses (VoidCatRDC)

- Backlog
- Todo
- In Progress

- Phase 3 (#EF4444)
- Phase 4 (#8B5CF6)
- Phase 5 (#0EA5E9)
- Feature (#BB87FC)
- Improvement (#4EA7FC)
- Bug (#EB5757)

Note: A team-filtered label call with the team name returned an argument validation error (the API expects a teamId). Workspace-wide labels retrieved successfully; team-scoped queries should use `teamId: 82fc39e5-dd4e-4cd0-81a4-fcf63a32e158`.

Sync Project with Linear

---

_**Assistant**_

I’m going to scan the repository for Linear sync sources (draft issues and checklists) and then create any missing Phase 5 issues in Linear under the correct team/project with phase labels. I’ll read the Linear docs files to extract Phase 5 tasks to sync and determine the expected project/label structure before creating or updating issues. I’m going to create a missing Linear label for Phase 6 and update the repo’s Linear draft issues document to reference the actual existing Linear issues to keep docs in sync.

```

```

I’m going to tag the Phase 6 issues in Linear with the new “Phase 6” label and update the docs to reflect the completed sync status. I’ll sync your Forbidden Library project with Linear by validating connectivity, aligning labels, updating issues, and reflecting the changes in your repo docs.

## Plan

- Validate Linear MCP connectivity and workspace context
- Identify team/project targets
- Create missing label(s) and apply to current release issues
- Update in-repo Linear docs to match live state
- Summarize results and propose next steps

## What I did

- Verified Linear is reachable via `mcp.json` entry for `linear` and confirmed your team: `VoidCatRDC`.
- Found the active release project: “Forbidden Library v1.0 Release - Phase 6 QA & Packaging.”
- Created a workspace label: `Phase 6` (color `#06B6D4`) for consistency with your documented phases.
- Tagged the Phase 6 issue set with the `Phase 6` label:
  - VOI-66 Cross-Platform Testing: Windows/macOS/Linux full feature sweep
  - VOI-67 Frontend Sentry Integration (SvelteKit)
  - VOI-68 User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Flow-of-thought workflows
  - VOI-69 Crash Reporting Setup with privacy controls and symbolication
  - VOI-70 Code signing & packaging for Windows/macOS/Linux
  - VOI-71 Draft v1.0 Release Notes
  - VOI-72 Distribution page and downloads with checksums
  - VOI-73 Version Tagging v1.0.0
  - VOI-74 Documentation: Update README and /docs to final native architecture
  - VOI-75 User Feedback Channel Setup
- Updated `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md` “Created Issues” section to reference the actual, live Linear issues and clarify that Phase 6 label is now standardized.

## Quick snapshot

- Team: `VoidCatRDC`
- Project: “Forbidden Library v1.0 Release - Phase 6 QA & Packaging”
- Labels now present: Phase 0–5 (existing), plus new Phase 6
- Cycles: none currently defined
- Recent issues: VOI-66 … VOI-75 (all updated with `Phase 6` label)

Repo changes

- Updated file: `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md` to reflect the live issues and note the Phase 6 label.

## Requirements coverage

- Sync Linear configuration: Done (verified `mcp.json` and connectivity)
- Align labels for current release: Done (Phase 6 created and applied)
- Update docs to match Linear: Done (docs/linear updated)

## Next steps (optional)

- Back-link Linear issue IDs into your top-level checklist file(s): `Project Checklist_ Forbidden Library - Ground-Up Implementation.md` (root and/or `` copy).
- Define a current cycle in Linear for Phase 6 with target dates to support reporting.
- If you want, I can also push any additional drafts from `as new issues, avoid duplicates, and attach relevant` artifacts.

Do all of those. Make sure there's only ONE forbidden Library project on Linear or github

---

_**Assistant**_

I’m going to audit and update repo docs for Linear backlinks, canonicalize the Linear project (set dates, archive redundant projects), and search GitHub for duplicate repos to ensure there’s only one “Forbidden Library” project. I’m going to: 1) deprecate the old GitHub repo by updating its README and opening a deprecation issue, 2) update your local checklists to back-link Linear issues, and 3) add canonical Linear project details to docs/README.

```

```

```

```

I’m going to: 1) update the root project checklist with Linear backlinks, 2) deprecate the old GitHub repo by overwriting its README and adding a DEPRECATED.md, and 3) open a deprecation issue on the old repo to ensure there’s only one active “Forbidden Library” project.

```

```

I’ll consolidate Forbidden Library to a single canonical project by updating Linear (one active project, labels, issue tagging) and GitHub (deprecate the old repo, point to the new one), and back-link your checklists.

## Plan

- Canonicalize Linear: keep one project, set dates, archive extras, apply labels
- Back-link Linear issues in your project checklists
- Deprecate the old GitHub repo and point to the canonical repo
- Update docs with canonical Linear project link
- Summarize results; list any manual steps still needed

## Actions completed

1. Linear canonicalization

- Canonical project set and dated:
  - Name: “Forbidden Library (Phase 6)”
  - URL: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbidden-library-phase-6-d55d9c47a500
  - Dates: `startDate=2025-08-27`, `targetDate=2025-09-06`
- Archived other Forbidden Library projects:
  - [Archived] Forbidden Library - Prototype to Production
  - [Archived] ForbiddenLibrary v1.3 Critical Remediation
- Created and standardized label:
  - `Phase 6` (color `#06B6D4`)
- Tagged current Phase 6 issues with `Phase 6`:
  - VOI-66 … VOI-75 (Cross-Platform Testing, Sentry, UAT, Signing/Packaging, Release Notes, Distribution, Version Tagging, Docs, Feedback Channel)
- Note: Cycles are empty; creation is not available via current toolset. Project dates are set as a proxy schedule.

2. Back-links added to checklists

- Updated linear references throughout your checklists:
  - `Project Checklist_ Forbidden Library - Ground-Up Implementation.md` (root)
  - `docs/Project Checklist_ Forbidden Library - Ground-Up Implementation.md`
- Added direct links to:
  - VOI-66, VOI-67, VOI-68, VOI-69, VOI-70, VOI-71, VOI-72, VOI-73, VOI-74, VOI-75

3. Docs updated for canonical Linear project

- `README.md`: added Canonical project link and de-duplication note
- `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md`: “Created Issues” now points to the live Phase 6 issues; added note about the `Phase 6` label

4. GitHub de-duplication (ensure one active repo)

- Old repo `ForbiddenLibrary` is deprecated in place:
  - `README.md`: replaced with deprecation notice pointing to canonical repo `forbidden-library-native`
  - Added `DEPRECATED.md` with canonical pointers
  - Opened issue to track archiving/locking: https://github.com/sorrowscry86/ForbiddenLibrary/issues/1
- Canonical repo remains: `forbidden-library-native` (this workspace)

## Where things stand now

- Linear
  - One active Forbidden Library project: “Forbidden Library (Phase 6)”
  - Others archived
  - Issues VOI-66…VOI-75 tagged with `Phase 6`

- GitHub
  - Canonical repository: https://github.com/sorrowscry86/forbidden-library-native
  - Legacy repository deprecated in-place:
    - README + DEPRECATED.md updated
    - Deprecation issue opened to finish archiving/locking

## Manual steps to truly have “one” on GitHub

- Go to the old repo Settings and:
  - Set “Archive this repository”
  - Optionally lock issues and PRs
  - Add a short description pointing to `forbidden-library-native`
- These are tracked in: https://github.com/sorrowscry86/ForbiddenLibrary/issues/1

## Requirements coverage

- Back-link Linear IDs into top-level checklists: Done
- Define current plan timeframe: Done (project dates set; cycles are not supported via current tools)
- Archive redundant Linear projects: Done
- Update docs with canonical Linear project link: Done
- Ensure only one active Forbidden Library project:
  - Linear: Done (one active, others archived)
  - GitHub: Functionally done (old repo deprecated with pointers). Final “one” status requires archive toggle in repo settings (tracked in issue)

## Quick references

- Canonical Linear project: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbidden-library-phase-6-d55d9c47a500
- Example issues:
  - VOI-66: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-66/cross-platform-testing-windowsmacoslinux-full-feature-sweep
  - VOI-70: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-70/code-signing-and-packaging-for-windowsmacoslinux
  - VOI-71: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/issue/VOI-71/draft-v10-release-notes
- Deprecated repo tracker: https://github.com/sorrowscry86/ForbiddenLibrary/issues/1

If you’d like, I can also add a “Distribution” section to the canonical repo `README.md` with the release links and checksum commands once the first RC artifacts are published.
