# Verifying Linear MCP Server Connectivity and Data (2025-08-27 11:08Z)

_**User**_

Check Linear

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll quickly probe the Linear MCP server by listing teams to confirm it's reachable and correctly configured; if successful, I’ll summarize the workspace teams and next steps. I’m going to query Linear for key workspace metadata (statuses, cycles, projects, labels, and a few recent issues) to verify connectivity and provide a concise snapshot of your setup. I’ll fetch labels (workspace-wide) and list all cycles to complete the snapshot and confirm everything’s accessible. I’ll verify your Linear MCP setup is reachable and summarize the key workspace state so you know it’s wired correctly.

## Plan
- Confirm MCP connectivity to Linear
- Identify available team(s)
- Pull team workflow statuses
- List projects, labels, and cycles
- Show a quick slice of recent issues for sanity

## Connectivity
- Status: Connected to Linear MCP at `https://mcp.linear.app/sse`
- Team(s): 
  - `VoidCatRDC` (id: `82fc39e5-dd4e-4cd0-81a4-fcf63a32e158`)

## Team Workflow Statuses (VoidCatRDC)
- Backlog
- Todo
- In Progress
- Done
- Canceled
- Duplicate

## Projects (VoidCatRDC)
- Forbidden Library v1.0 Release - Phase 6 QA & Packaging
  - URL: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbidden-library-v10-release-phase-6-qa-and-packaging-d55d9c47a500
  - Summary: Cross-platform QA, UAT, monitoring, and release packaging for v1.0
- Forbidden Library - Prototype to Production
  - URL: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbidden-library-prototype-to-production-fb5a081fbc87
  - Summary: Native desktop migration per mandate
- ForbiddenLibrary v1.3 Critical Remediation
  - URL: https://linear.app/voidcatrdc/project/forbiddenlibrary-v13-critical-remediation-efaecaa43f34
  - Summary: Strategic remediation of critical system failures

## Labels (workspace-wide)
- ForbiddenLibrary (#1F2937)
- Phase 0 (#2563EB)
- Phase 1 (#10B981)
- Phase 2 (#F59E0B)
- Phase 3 (#EF4444)
- Phase 4 (#8B5CF6)
- Phase 5 (#0EA5E9)
- Feature (#BB87FC)
- Improvement (#4EA7FC)
- Bug (#EB5757)

Note: A team-filtered label call with the team name returned an argument validation error (the API expects a teamId). Workspace-wide labels retrieved successfully; team-scoped queries should use `teamId: 82fc39e5-dd4e-4cd0-81a4-fcf63a32e158`.

## Cycles

## Recent Issues (VoidCatRDC, last updated)
- VOI-75: User Feedback Channel Setup
- VOI-74: Documentation: Update README and /docs to final native architecture
- VOI-73: Version Tagging v1.0.0
- VOI-72: Distribution page and downloads with checksums

- VOI-66: Cross-Platform Testing: Windows/macOS/Linux full feature sweep

All above are currently in Backlog and primarily associated with “Forbidden Library v1.0 Release - Phase 6 QA & Packaging.”

## Requirements Coverage
- Verify Linear MCP connectivity: Done
- Enumerate teams: Done
- Fetch statuses/labels/cycles/projects: Done (cycles empty)
- List recent issues: Done

## What’s next (optional)
- I can sync the remaining Phase 5/6 tasks from `` or your in-repo checklists into Linear with phase labels.
- If you want team-scoped labels or new cycles, I can create them and align statuses to your current release cadence.

Sync Project with Linear

---

_**Assistant**_

I’m going to scan the repository for Linear sync sources (draft issues and checklists) and then create any missing Phase 5 issues in Linear under the correct team/project with phase labels. I’ll read the Linear docs files to extract Phase 5 tasks to sync and determine the expected project/label structure before creating or updating issues. I’m going to create a missing Linear label for Phase 6 and update the repo’s Linear draft issues document to reference the actual existing Linear issues to keep docs in sync. 
```

```
I’m going to tag the Phase 6 issues in Linear with the new “Phase 6” label and update the docs to reflect the completed sync status. I’ll sync your Forbidden Library project with Linear by validating connectivity, aligning labels, updating issues, and reflecting the changes in your repo docs.

## Plan
- Validate Linear MCP connectivity and workspace context
- Identify team/project targets
- Create missing label(s) and apply to current release issues
- Update in-repo Linear docs to match live state
- Summarize results and propose next steps

## What I did
- Verified Linear is reachable via `mcp.json` entry for `linear` and confirmed your team: `VoidCatRDC`.
- Found the active release project: “Forbidden Library v1.0 Release - Phase 6 QA & Packaging.”
- Created a workspace label: `Phase 6` (color `#06B6D4`) for consistency with your documented phases.
- Tagged the Phase 6 issue set with the `Phase 6` label:
  - VOI-66 Cross-Platform Testing: Windows/macOS/Linux full feature sweep
  - VOI-67 Frontend Sentry Integration (SvelteKit)
  - VOI-68 User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Flow-of-thought workflows
  - VOI-69 Crash Reporting Setup with privacy controls and symbolication
  - VOI-70 Code signing & packaging for Windows/macOS/Linux
  - VOI-71 Draft v1.0 Release Notes
  - VOI-72 Distribution page and downloads with checksums
  - VOI-73 Version Tagging v1.0.0
  - VOI-74 Documentation: Update README and /docs to final native architecture
  - VOI-75 User Feedback Channel Setup
- Updated `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md` “Created Issues” section to reference the actual, live Linear issues and clarify that Phase 6 label is now standardized.

## Quick snapshot
- Team: `VoidCatRDC`
- Project: “Forbidden Library v1.0 Release - Phase 6 QA & Packaging”
- Labels now present: Phase 0–5 (existing), plus new Phase 6
- Cycles: none currently defined
- Recent issues: VOI-66 … VOI-75 (all updated with `Phase 6` label)

Repo changes
- Updated file: `PHASE_5_Completion_Issues.md` to reflect the live issues and note the Phase 6 label.

## Requirements coverage
- Sync Linear configuration: Done (verified `mcp.json` and connectivity)
- Align labels for current release: Done (Phase 6 created and applied)
- Update docs to match Linear: Done (docs/linear updated)

## Next steps (optional)
- Back-link Linear issue IDs into your top-level checklist file(s): `Project Checklist_ Forbidden Library - Ground-Up Implementation.md` (root and/or `` copy).
- Define a current cycle in Linear for Phase 6 with target dates to support reporting.
- If you want, I can also push any additional drafts from `` as new issues, avoid duplicates, and attach relevant `` artifacts.

Do all of those. Make sure there's only ONE forbidden Library project on Linear or github
