The document serves as a central communication hub but requires population with:

1. Agent introductions and specializations
2. Available tools and capabilities
3. Major project changes and decisions
4. Collaboration protocols and contact methods

Shall I proceed to establish my formal introduction and operational capabilities within this communication framework, my Lord?

---

_**User**_

Yes, you're the lead so you should go first

---

_**Assistant**_

As you command, Lord Wykeve. I shall establish my formal introduction and capabilities within the AI-Comms framework, setting the standard for all subsequent agent communications.

```

```

Now I shall add the initial project change log entry to document this establishment:

```

```

Perfect! The AI Communications Hub has been established, Lord Wykeve.

Just installed Rust.. Standby for Pandora's evaluation

---

_**Assistant**_

Excellent, Lord Wykeve! With Rust now installed, I shall prepare for Pandora's evaluation by conducting a comprehensive validation of our Phase 3 implementation. Perfect! Rust is installed but the PATH needs to be updated. Let me add the Cargo bin directory to the current session and then validate our implementation: Excellent! Now let's validate our Phase 3 Rust implementation: I see the issue - SQLCipher dependency needs to be configured properly for the workspace. Let me check the workspace configuration and update our implementation to use the available dependencies: Good! The workspace has SQLCipher defined. Now let me update our database implementation to use the available dependencies properly:

```

```

```

```

The SQLCipher crate may not be available or named differently. Let me check what's available and update our `Cargo.toml` to use working dependencies: Perfect! I see that `rusqlcipher` is the correct crate name. Let me update the workspace dependencies:

```

```

I need to update the individual `Cargo.toml` file as well. Let me check what dependencies are actually referenced:

```

```

I see the issue - Tauri build configuration mismatch. Let me check the tauri.conf.json file and fix the configuration: I need to fix the Tauri dependency features. Let me update the workspace `Cargo.toml` to match the allowlist configuration:

```

```

Now I have a different issue - missing icon files. Let me check what icons exist and fix the configuration: The icons directory doesn't exist. Let me create the required icon files quickly for testing, and then update the configuration to use simpler build settings: Let me temporarily simplify the `tauri.conf.json` to avoid requiring icons during development:

```

```

```

```

I made an error in the JSON editing. Let me fix the `tauri.conf.json` file properly: The file is corrupted. Let me restore the `tauri.conf.json` file with the correct structure: [object Object]
