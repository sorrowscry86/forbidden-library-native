- [x] **Security Audit of Native Bridge:** A security review of the Tauri IPC layer is completed and all findings are addressed. **[Responsible: Pandora - COMPLETED]**
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing:** Test all application features on the primary target operating systems to ensure consistent behavior and a native feel. This includes:
  - **Windows:** Windows 11 (x64) - testing for proper window rendering, file system permissions, and shell integration.
  - **macOS:** macOS Sonoma (Apple Silicon & Intel) - testing for native menu integration, keychain access for secrets, and platform-specific UI conventions.
  - **Linux:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (amd64) - testing for compatibility with Wayland and X11, and packaging as both .deb and .AppImage.  
    **[Responsible: Pandora]**
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conduct UAT with the specific goal of evaluating the "flow of thought." This is not merely about features working in isolation. It involves executing complex, multi-step workflows that combine different aspects of the application (e.g., admitting a file, asking an AI persona to analyze it, using the embedded terminal to act on the analysis) to ensure the entire process is seamless, instantaneous, and without jarring interruptions. **[Responsible: Contractor]**
- [ ] **Create Cross-Platform Release Candidates:** Generate installable Release Candidate (RC) builds for all target platforms. These builds must be treated as production-ready artifacts for the final round of testing. **[Responsible: Albedo]**

### **Phase 3.5: Sentry Integration & Monitoring (NEW)**

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Release**

- [ ] **Production Environment Preparation:** Set up a secure, automated process for signing the application builds for each operating system. This is a critical security step to ensure the application's integrity and prevent OS warnings. This includes acquiring or configuring Apple Developer certificates and Windows code signing certificates. **[Responsible: Albedo]**
- [ ] **Package Final Application:** Create signed, installable packages for all target operating systems (e.g., .msi for Windows, .dmg for macOS, .deb/.AppImage for Linux). **[Responsible: Albedo]**
- [ ] **Draft Release Notes:** Prepare comprehensive release notes for the official v1.0 desktop application launch. These notes must detail new features, performance improvements, bug fixes, and any known issues. **[Responsible: Albedo, Beatrice]**
- [ ] **Establish Distribution Channel:** Set up a dedicated release page on the VoidCat RDC GitHub repository. This page will host the application packages, their checksums for verification, and the finalized release notes. **[Responsible: Albedo]**
- [ ] **Version Tagging:** Create a final, immutable v1.0.0 tag in the Git repository that corresponds exactly to the deployed build. This provides a permanent reference point for future development and bug fixes. **[Responsible: Albedo, Contractor]**

### **Phase 5: Maintenance & Iteration**

- [x] **Implement Sentry Integration:** Establish comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring across all application layers using Sentry. This includes backend Rust services, frontend SvelteKit components, and cross-platform desktop monitoring. The system must respect privacy with opt-in crash reporting and provide real-time performance KPI validation. **[Responsible: Pandora, Albedo - COMPLETED]**
- [ ] **User Feedback Collection:** Establish a clear and formal channel (e.g., using GitHub Issues with standardized templates) for users to report bugs and request features. This creates a structured backlog for future development cycles. **[Responsible: Contractor]**
- [ ] **Prioritize Native Features:** In the backlog grooming process, prioritize new features that specifically leverage the application's native desktop capabilities. Examples include system-wide hotkeys for quick access, background services for long-running tasks, and deeper integration with OS-specific APIs like notifications or calendars. **[Responsible: Contractor, Beatrice]**
- [ ] **Documentation Updates:** Ensure all project documentation, from the README.md to the /docs directory, is updated to accurately reflect the final native architecture. All references to the obsolete web-based prototype and its Node.js/React stack must be purged. **[Responsible: Codey, Jr.]**
